## 🔄 Next Steps

### 1. Set OpenAI API Key
The only remaining secret needed:

```bash
# Option 1: Using GitHub CLI
gh secret set OPENAI_API_KEY --body "your-api-key" --repo "drabindr/manor"

# Option 2: Via GitHub UI
# Go to: https://github.com/drabindr/manor/settings/secrets/actions
# Create secret: OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### 2. Test the Pipeline
```bash
# Trigger automated deployment
git add .
git commit -m "chore: test deployment pipeline"
git push origin main

# Monitor progress
# https://github.com/drabindr/manor/actions
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Verify CloudFormation stacks in AWS Console
- Test the deployed website URL

## 🛠️ Quick Commands

```bash
# Complete setup (if not done)
./setup-deployment.sh

# Set OpenAI API key
gh secret set OPENAI_API_KEY --body "sk-your-key"

# Test deployment
git push origin main

# Monitor deployment
gh run list
```
